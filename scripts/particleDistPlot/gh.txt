This PR makes the `finest_part_data` working with the new format
of particles data (like `iCells` had a size `(num_of_part)` while now,
it is of size `(nom_of_part, ndim)`. It can be used with something like :

```
allParts = Run(run_path).GetParticles(time=time, pop_name=pop_name)
particles = finest_part_data(allParts)

# ..... scatter plot in x-vx plane
plt.scatter(particles["proton"].x,
            particles["proton"].v[:,0],
            s=particles["proton"].weights*100)
```

While used in 1D, not all the functions have been tested, neither their 2D
form.
