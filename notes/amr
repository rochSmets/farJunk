# ___ PatchHierarchy
  IS-A
  HAS-A vector of PatchLevel, PatchDescriptor, BaseGridGeometry
  also contains the max nbr of levels

# ___ PatchLevel
  IS-A
  HAS-A BoxLevel, PatchContainer, BoxContainer,
        collection of local Patches, BaseGridGeometry, PatchDescriptor,
        IntVector refinement ratio
  when a PatchLevel is constructed, a PatchGeometry is constructed by
  the GridGeometry and then set on the Patch

# ___ BoxLevel
  IS-A
  HAS-A 
  describe a collection of Boxes (in the metadata sense)
  it contains the metadata for the associated patchLevel

# ___ BoxContainer
  IS-A
  HAS-A
  methods : intersectBoxes (must be unordered)
            makeTree
            removeIntersections
            findOverlaps
            hasOverlaps
  can be "unordered" (like a set) or "ordered" (like a list)

# ___ Box
  IS-A
  HAS-A collection of index (lower, upper), blockId(globalId, periodicId)
  methods : growing/shrinking
            shifting
            coarsening/refining
            intersection
  the globalId contains the MPI rank, & a localId

# ___ BoundaryBox
  IS-A
  HAS-A
  says how the patch touches the boundary (along a node, an edge, a face)
  & whether the boundary is at the lower or upper extent of the patch
  in each coordination direction

# ___ Connector
  IS-A
  HAS-A
  needed to store overlap relationship between 2 boxes in a BoxLevel
  (or 2 different BoxLevels, from the "base" 2 the "head")
  the width of a connector is an IntVector (basically the nbr of cells
  between the 2 boxes ?)

# ___ GridGeometry
  IS-A BaseGridGeometry
  HAS-A BoxContainer (define the full extent of the computational mesh
        at the coarsest level), IntVector (for periodicity)
        data relating index space to physical coordinates
  methods : getPhysicalDomain & computePhysicalDomain (both describe
  the physical domain and return a container of Boxes)
  SAMRAI provides a CartesianGridGeometry

# ___ PatchGeometry
  IS-A
  HAS-A PatchBoundaries (container of BoundaryBoxes), bool (touches a
        regular or periodic boundary)
        data relating index space of the Patch to physical coordinates
  describes the relation of the patch to the problem boundary
  holds methods to determine whether a patch touches a problem boundary
  (physical or periodic)
  methods : getTouchesRegularBoundary & getTouchesPeriodicBoundary
  (return boolean)
  SAMRAI provides a CartesianPatchGeometry
  a PatchGeometry is created by a GridGeometry

# ___ Variable
  IS-A
  HAS-A dimension, name, instance Id, PatchDataFactory
  abstractly represents a quantity (density, flux) that can be
  instanciated on the mesh hierarchy
  a Variable has a name and persistently exist in the simulation
  it define the data type and the centering
  but it do not contain storage for data on the mesh
  abstract base class : define how data can be copied and communicated
  for PHARE : FieldVariable and ParticleVariable
  a Variable subclass creates the corresponding PatchDataFactory
  and this PatchDataFactory creates the PatchData
  a Variable also have a context (old, new...)
  all of these are stored in a VariableDataBase
  combination of Variable and Context gives a unique data Id
  it is stored in the VariableDataBase
  this Id is used to Patch::getPatchData(int Id)

# ___ Patch
  IS-A
  HAS-A Box, PatchDescriptor, PatchGeometry, vector of PatchData
  they are local (in the MPI sense)

# ___ PatchData
  IS-A
  HAS-A Box (box and ghost box), IntVector (ghost width), double (timestamp)
  interface with the complete collection of methods used by SAMRAI
  2 manipulate data on a hierarchy
  this class can be derived in CellData and NodeData
  for PHARE : FieldData and ParticleData





# ___ 
  IS-A
  HAS-A
